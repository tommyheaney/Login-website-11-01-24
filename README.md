## Introduction

This repository hosts an HTML page that serves as a user registration form with an emphasis on password strength. Leveraging `zxcvbn`, a password strength meter, the form provides real-time feedback on the entered password's strength and enforces a minimum length requirement.

## Features

- Real-time password strength feedback using `zxcvbn`.
- Front-end form validation for email and password fields.
- Enforces acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy before submission.
- Styled with CSS for a clean and modern user interface.

## Prerequisites

No specific installation is required to run this project. Any modern web browser should be able to render the page properly.

## Usage

To view the registration form, simply open the `login-code-dynamic.html` file in a web browser.

## Implementation Details

- jQuery is used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- `zxcvbn` library is used to assess password strength.
- The CSS is contained within the HTML file for simplicity, following the style rules provided.
- The form has a password strength indicator that changes colour based on the strength assessed by `zxcvbn`.
- JavaScript is used to prevent form submission if the password strength is inadequate.
